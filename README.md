# 🥯 Bagel Technical Assessments

This repository contains all technical assessments and coding challenges used by Bagel (bagel.ai) for evaluating potential team members.

## 📁 Assessment Projects

### [`fullstack-home-test/`](./fullstack-home-test/)
**Full-Stack Developer Assessment**
- **Technologies**: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React Query, Mantine UI
- **Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Level**: Mid to Senior Full-Stack Developer
- **Focus**: End-to-end task management application with CRUD operations, optimistic updates, and proper error handling

## 🎯 Assessment Philosophy

At Bagel, we believe in:
- **Quality over Quantity** - We'd rather see well-crafted code than rushed features
- **Real-World Scenarios** - Our assessments mirror actual work you'd do at Bagel
- **Candidate Experience** - One-command setup, clear instructions, helpful guidance
- **Fair Evaluation** - Consistent rubrics and multiple perspectives in review

## 🚀 Quick Start for Any Assessment

Each assessment includes:
- **One-command setup** - Get running immediately with `./bagel-test.sh up`
- **Clear documentation** - Know exactly what to build and how you'll be evaluated  
- **Modern tooling** - Work with the same stack we use at Bagel
- **Helpful guidance** - TODO comments and hints guide you to success

## 📋 For Bagel Team Members

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a comprehensive README with setup instructions
